I am Sandeep, currently working as Research Associate at Technical University of Ilmenau in Germany. I am scientific computing engineer where I am working in an interdisciplinary environment. My work overlaps the aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering and of course computer science. At the moment, I am focusing on a turbulence related problem and making some successful attempt in modelling and predicting it by means of data-driven approached such as machine learning. Until now, I have tested simple deep neural network, recurrent neural network and reservoir computing on my time-series data.


Professional and research history
======

Before starting current job in July 2019, I have working at IKE, University of Stuttgart towards my PhD since January 2016. My prime aim was to develop data-driven models for heat transfer prediction in a new-type of power plants. As I was missing the experimental data. So, I did several highly accurate and computationally expensive (1 simulation takes approx 400,000 CPU-hours!) simulations on supercomputers using up to 50,000 CPUs at once. Some of [the data from these numerical experiments were released](https://www.ike.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/sco2/dns/) for benchmarking new methods. After having data in hand, I worked on some simple regression based model and then machine learning based models including decision tree, random forest and deep neural network.
