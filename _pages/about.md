Servus! I am Sandeep, currently working as Research Associate at Technical University of Ilmenau in Germany. I am scientific computing engineer, where I am leading research in an interdisciplinary environment. My work overlaps with applied physics, mechanical engineering and of course computer science. At the moment, I am focusing on a turbulence related problem and making some successful attempt in modelling and predicting it by means of data-driven approach such as machine learning. Until now, I have tested deep neural network, recurrent neural network and reservoir computing on my time-series data.


Professional and research history
======

Before starting current job in July 2019, I was working at IKE, University of Stuttgart towards my PhD. My prime aim was to develop data-driven models for heat transfer prediction in a new-type of power plants. As I was missing the experimental data, so I did several highly accurate and computationally expensive (1 simulation takes approx 400,000 CPU-hours!) simulations on supercomputers using up to 50,000 CPUs at once. Some of [the data from these numerical experiments were released](https://www.ike.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/sco2/dns/) for benchmarking of new methods. After having data in hand, I worked on some regression based models and then explored the machine learning based methods including decision tree, random forest and deep neural network. My work was not only limited to model development but I also have to perform data analytics for the high-fidelity data coming out from the simulation. During data analytics part, I developed different toolkits within MATLAB and Python to perform variety of task such as probability analysis, eigenvalue decomposition, correlations, and statistical analysis. 


I hold a Master of Technology degree from IIT Delhi in Energy Studies, where I had unique opportunity to dive deep into the energy resources modeling from technical, economical and environmental perspective. I did my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineer from RTU Kota. During bachelors, I learned about basics of programming and techno-managerial side including operation research and applied mathematics.
